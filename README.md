# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use tectonic plates, their locations and the frequency of seismic activity to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. First an API call was used to bring the tectonic plate data into the data. Then the geographical maps was populated with GeoJSON data. Finally layers and interactive features were added to the map.
